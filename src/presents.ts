    note: 'Wanted to give you something special for the 1st birthday of money we celebrate together. An advent calendar seemed appropriate. A pack of M&Ms came second. Ha. Only cause it reminds me of our second date. I took note of your prefer snacks on our first date and from then on I wanted to know more about you. The calendar is to make it extra special. Hopefully in the future I can afford to give you an advent calendar with just jewelry. For now it\'s one full of mixed things. Happy birthday eve.',
