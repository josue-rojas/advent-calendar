    note: `Wanted to give you something special for the 1st birthday we celebrate together. An advent calendar seemed appropriate. A pack of M&Ms came second. Ha! üòõ. Only cause it reminds me of our second date. I took mental notes of your prefer snacks on our first date and from then on I wanted to know more about you. The calendar is to make it extra special and to shower you with small gifts. Hopefully in the future I can afford to give you an advent calendar with just jewelry. For now it's one full of mixed things. Happy birthday eve. I hope you enjoy the tiny presents I got you.P.S try not to cheat by going to this site before I give you your present unless you are really curious. `

    I think this idea was kinda ambitious for me but worth it! (it was last minute when we saw the advent calendars in marshalls). But it will be worth it. 
    I love you so much! I will always try to make you happy and spoil you as much as I can.
