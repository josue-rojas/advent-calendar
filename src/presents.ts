    note: `Wanted to give you something special for the 1st birthday we celebrate together. An advent calendar seemed appropriate. A pack of M&Ms came second. Ha! 😛. Only cause it reminds me of our second date. I took mental notes of your prefer snacks on our first date and from then on I wanted to know more about you. The calendar is to make it extra special and to shower you with small gifts. Hopefully in the future I can afford to give you an advent calendar with just jewelry. For now it's one full of mixed things. Happy birthday eve. I hope you enjoy the tiny presents I got you.P.S try not to cheat by going to this site before I give you your present unless you are really curious. `

    Although today is your special day I rather celebrate this first birthday with you by celebrating all month long with presents. 
    I think this idea was kinda ambitious for me but worth it! (it was last minute when we saw the advent calendars in marshalls). But it will be worth it. 
    I love you so much! I will always try to make you happy and spoil you as much as I can.
    Today’s gifts: Balloons, Cake, Roses, Book, and a song. `,

I felt really terrible for not being next to you in that toy store. So I also got you m&ms. I’m sorry for making you mad. I understand we were both hungry. I do love you very much. Always. And I always appreciate you for teaching me to talk through things. That is why our relationship is great. We talk through things. We solve stuff. And one things is always constant. The love.
